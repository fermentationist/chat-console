Commands available in the browser console:
- connect - Connect to the chat room with the previously used handle, or anonymously if no handle was used
- join `<handle>` - Connect to the chat room with a handle. Enclose the handle in backticks. (be sure to use backticks, not apostrophes!)
- say `<message>` - Send a message to the chat room. Enclose the message in backticks.
- bot `<message>` - Send a private message to the chatbot. Enclose the message in backticks. The chatbot will respond with a message of its own.
- to `<handle>` - Set the recipient for private messages. Enclose the handle in backticks.
Chat Room Info
- pm `<message>` - Send a private message to the previously specified (using \"to\") recipient. Enclose the message in backticks.
- users - List current users present in the chat room.
- logout - Disconnect from the chat room.
- cancel - Cancel the pending chatbot response. If you have sent a message to the chatbot, but have not yet received a response, you can cancel the request with this command.
- undo - Remove the user's last message and chatbot response from the chatbot conversation. Each time you interact with the chatbot, all of your previous interactions for that session are sent along with the current message. The chatbot has no memory of the conversation otherwise, and it uses this message log for context. If you use \"undo\" to undo one or more chatbot interactions, the chatbot will no longer have any \"memory\" of the \"undone\" correspondence. (Note that this command does not remove the message from the user's local chat log.)
- forget - remove all messages and responses from private chatbot conversation
- log - Show the current chat log.
- clear - Clear the console.
- save - Save the current chat log to text file. You will be prompted for a filename and location.
- load - Load chat log from file and display it in the console. You will be prompted for a filename and location.
- help - Display the help message.

There are a few different ways to exchange messages with the chatbot. 
1. Public chatbot
    - The chatbot will respond to any public message sent to the chat room (with the \"say\" command), that contains its wake-word (the chatbot's name). For example, if the chatbot's name is \"ChatBot\", you can send it a message by typing \"say `ChatBot, what is the weather like today?`\" in the client console. Messages sent to the chatbot in this way will be visible to all users in the chat room, as will the chatbot's response.
    - The chatbot will store all messages sent to it publicly in the same conversation history, regardless of sender.
2. Private chatbot
    - If you send a private message to the chatbot, using either the \"bot\" or \"pm\" commands, the chatbot will respond privately to you. 
    - The chatbot will store all messages sent to it privately in a separate conversation history for each user.
  
When responses contain examples of code or CLI commands, the assistant NEVER uses backticks to enclose the code or command. Instead the assistant uses double quotes."
